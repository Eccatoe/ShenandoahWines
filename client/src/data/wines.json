    "description": "Founded in 2000, Veramar Vineyard was one of the first successful wineries in the northern Shenandoah Valley. The vineyard is run by James and Della Bogaty, who were original members of the Shenandoah Valley Wine Trail. Justin, their son, is the winemaker. He is a graduate of VMI and has a certificate of oenology from UC Davis. Our wine is internationally-acclaimed, and is made at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.Veramar Vineyard is located of Rt 7 in the northern Shenandoah Valley AVA of Virginia. Right over the Blue Ridge Mountains from Loudoun County, Veramar is a short drive from Leesburg or Winchester, and easily accessible from Washington, DC, Northern Virginia, Frederick, MD, Harpers Ferry, WV, and the Interstate 81 corridor.This hidden gem, nestled in the rolling hills near the Shenandoah River, has an expansive views of the mountains from the 28 acres of vineyards and the rustic yet elegant tasting room and terrace. In this idyllic setting we grow Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Seyval Blanc, Traminette, Norton, Albariño, Vidal Blanc and Malbec wine grapes, and make Virginian wine across a spectrum of varietals and blends. Each wine distinctively expresses our dedication to premium Virginia winemaking.The Bogaty family founded Veramar in 2000, when there were very few wineries operating successfully in this part of the state. Since then, the business has grown to include their son, Justin Bogaty, as winemaker, and there has certainly been a tremendous boom in the Virginian wine industry since then, especially in Loudoun County. But over the years we have never lost our values of family and sustainability - every aspect of Veramar, from the vineyard to the winemaking itself, is managed with the goal of creating a family business that can be passed down to many generations of Bogatys to come. We strive to be grounded enough to forego trends and fads in favor of the lasting principles that will sustain Veramar and Shenandoah Valley winemaking culture many years into the future.Our tasting room is open year-round, seven days a week, and opens daily at noon. The estate and vineyards are also the perfect setting for an elegant winery wedding or private party, a venue perfectly situated near Northern Virginia, Winchester, VA, and Washington, DC. We hope you'll visit us, and experience everything that premium Virginian wine has to offer!",
